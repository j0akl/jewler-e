# Collections

##Idea:
Form communities around collections, as there are many more groups
collecting things than one person might expect, think r/mk, watches,
pokemon cards, jewlery, cars, literally anything.

People can use their profile to show off their collections, as well
as typical posts (sorted by community). Users can sell items from
their collection, show them off, do whatever they want.

Selling:
 - OTO (open to offers)
 - NFS (not for sale)
 - OBO (price or best offer)
 - AUC (auction)
 - BIN (buy it now)

Posts should be mixed in with listings. Items attached to posts (optionally).

Communities vote on moderators, anyone in the community can apply,
only those in the top 80% of tenure in a commnity can vote to
prevent raids and the like.

Community based leaderboards, daily, weekly, all time.
Based on ratio of up/downvotes and total likes, profile
views, anything

Profile is split into two sections. Collections and Posts
The two are pretty intertwined.
Can sort a user's profile based on community

Communities:
 - classifieds (anything not-illegal goes)
 - hobbies/interests (collecting based or not)
 - locations

Same as jewlere, X% commission on every item sold

Profile badges, community based or not

Expandable tree comment view

Shouldn't be any harder to implement than jewlere, just a little more complex.
Way more money to be made if we expand the vision, start with a beta for
certain communities who are particularly conducive to the platform (r/mk)
to build hype. Eventually allow arbitrary community creation (at release)
