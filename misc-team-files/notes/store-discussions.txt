K-Cameron Jewlery
 - Spoke with Trisha Tom (Store Manager)

- Pros
 - mostly positive, gave comparisons from our idea to Poshmark
 - Liked the idea of us broadcasting their business to a wider audience
 - Liked having the 180 day return policy (maybe too long?)
 - Liked that it fills a small niche, there is no central online marketplace for jewlery
 - Didn't seem to worried about credibility, other than testing (related to the money-back garuntee)
   - not our responsibility, make that clear in the terms of the website (responsibility of the buyer)
   - responsibility of the seller to maintain their credibility, we should have a good reporting system
     to catch those that sell poor quality items or lie about what they are selling

- Cons
 - (This is just for the stores, not necessarily for us): Might take business away from
   stores that buy based on the gold value as individual sellers can sell on our website
   and get a better price for their jewlery
   - this is kind of a pro for us in the long term (con for onboarding stores at the start)

Potential Questions:
 - Big One: Would you consider using this service as a store owner?
 - Make sure the model is explained
 - Don't follow a script, just discuss the idea and see what they think
